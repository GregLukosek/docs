### Edit postbacks

For advanced integrations, you may want to provide additional information in your postback that isn't there by default. You can edit postbacks by following our [postback templating instructions](/pages/exports/ua-webhooks/#templating-your-postback-url), then clicking save. The postbacks in the Universal Ads interface follow the same syntax as Webhooks in Data Feeds. When the postback is saved, it is then validated - if you enter an invalid postback, you'll get an error at the top of your screen.

!!! tip "Reset Postbacks"

    We all make mistakes from time to time. If you need to reset your postbacks and your credentials, navigate to the **Account Settings** tab and look for the **Reset all settings** button. Be careful though! This will disable the ad partner, clear out all credentials and postbacks that you've set up, and return the ad partner to its basic configuration. You can then start afresh.
